## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

# What I learned

- I was able to learn how to do graphic with CSS for the first and it was fun, interesting & not as bad as I thought because I was able to be creative enough to thin outaide the box in every step of this challenge.

# Continued development

I want to contine to do more of this graphic and learn animation as time goes on because I feel the more project I pick the better I get and this has really helped me a lot. Makes me more creative minded and think smart than I used to.
